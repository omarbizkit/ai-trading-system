# Implementation Plan: Production Readiness

**Branch**: `002-production-readiness` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/omarb/dev/projects/ai-trading-system/specs/002-production-readiness/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Resolve critical production blocking issues in the AI Trading System to enable successful deployment to ai-trading.bizkit.dev. The system is 100% feature-complete but requires fixing 751 TypeScript errors, API connectivity issues, database configuration, and build pipeline failures to achieve production readiness.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.5 with Node.js 18+ (Astro 5.13.11 web framework)
**Primary Dependencies**: Astro, TailwindCSS, Supabase client, Lightweight Charts, TensorFlow.js
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with `trading_` prefixed tables, row-level security
**Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E/performance), contract testing framework
**Target Platform**: Web application deployed on Zeabur, SSR with Node.js adapter
**Project Type**: web - Astro SSR application with API routes and frontend components
**Performance Goals**: <2s page load, >90 Lighthouse score, real-time updates <500ms
**Constraints**: Zeabur free tier, Supabase shared instance, CoinGecko API rate limits
**Scale/Scope**: Portfolio showcase, 100+ concurrent users, 5 pages, 8 components, 12 API endpoints

**Technical Context (from user arguments)**: Production deploy readiness for project, I want to work any remaining typescript errors, API errors, DB errors and make application production ready

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Showcase-First**: ✅ PASS - Production readiness directly enhances showcase quality by eliminating errors and ensuring professional deployment

**Cost-Effective Deployment**: ✅ PASS - All fixes target existing free tier infrastructure (Zeabur, Supabase), no additional costs introduced

**Test-Driven (Portfolio-Appropriate)**: ✅ PASS - Focuses on making existing tests pass rather than adding enterprise-level coverage, appropriate scope for portfolio

**Modular & Reusable**: ✅ PASS - TypeScript fixes and API improvements enhance modularity, maintain clean separation of concerns

**Simplicity & Maintainability**: ✅ PASS - Error resolution improves code clarity and maintainability, follows YAGNI principles

**Paper Trading Only**: ✅ PASS - Production readiness maintains simulation-only operation, no real trading capabilities added

**Initial Assessment**: All constitutional principles PASS. No violations identified.

**Post-Design Assessment**: All constitutional principles still PASS after design phase. Design artifacts maintain constitutional compliance:
- Data model focuses on error resolution and monitoring, not new business complexity
- API contracts support debugging and health checking, enhance maintainability
- Quickstart scenarios validate production requirements efficiently
- No new external dependencies or costs introduced

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Astro SSR with API routes and frontend components

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy for Production Readiness**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base template
- Generate systematic error resolution tasks from research findings
- Create debugging and monitoring implementation tasks from API contracts
- Generate validation tasks from quickstart scenarios
- Focus on fix-first approach rather than test-first (existing codebase)

**Specific Task Categories**:

1. **Critical TypeScript Resolution** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - T001-T010: Fix blocking compilation errors by category
   - T011-T015: Resolve type safety violations in core components
   - T016-T020: Address test file type errors

2. **API Connectivity Restoration** (Priority: HIGH)
   - T021-T025: Debug and fix authentication middleware [P]
   - T026-T030: Resolve API endpoint registration issues [P]
   - T031-T035: Fix database connection and query errors [P]

3. **Production Environment Setup** (Priority: HIGH)
   - T036-T040: Configure Supabase production instance
   - T041-T045: Implement health monitoring endpoints [P]
   - T046-T050: Setup deployment configuration and testing

4. **Quality and Performance** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - T051-T055: Performance optimization and bundle analysis [P]
   - T056-T060: Accessibility and responsive design validation [P]
   - T061-T065: End-to-end testing and validation scenarios

5. **Monitoring and Maintenance** (Priority: LOW)
   - T066-T070: Production monitoring and alerting setup [P]
   - T071-T075: Documentation and runbook creation [P]

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Critical Path**: TypeScript → API → Database → Build → Deploy
- **Parallel Execution**: Mark [P] for independent debugging tasks
- **Validation Points**: Health checks after each major category
- **Rollback Strategy**: Each task should be reversible if needed

**Task Categorization Logic**:
- **Blocking Tasks**: Must complete before next category
- **Parallel Tasks**: Can run simultaneously (different files/services)
- **Validation Tasks**: Verify previous category completion
- **Optional Tasks**: Enhancement rather than critical fixes

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Fix-First Strategy**: Resolve existing issues before adding new features
- **Incremental Validation**: Test after each fix to ensure stability
- **Error Tracking**: Use data model entities to track resolution progress
- **Documentation**: Update quickstart scenarios as fixes are applied

**Dependencies and Constraints**:
- TypeScript errors must be resolved before successful build
- Database connectivity required for API endpoint testing
- Successful build required for deployment testing
- Environment variables needed for production validation

**Estimated Output**: 75 numbered, prioritized tasks organized by category

**Quality Gates**:
- After Critical Tasks: Successful TypeScript compilation
- After High Priority: All API endpoints responding correctly
- After Medium Priority: Performance targets met
- After All Tasks: Full quickstart scenarios passing

**Parallel Execution Examples**:
```bash
# Critical TypeScript fixes (different files)
Task: "Fix type mismatch errors in src/middleware.ts"
Task: "Fix implicit any types in src/components/AIPrediction.astro"
Task: "Fix property violations in src/lib/types/trading-user.ts"

# API debugging (different endpoints)
Task: "Debug authentication middleware issues"
Task: "Fix user profile API endpoint registration"
Task: "Resolve database connection in market data service"

# Performance optimization (different areas)
Task: "Optimize bundle size for trading components"
Task: "Implement lazy loading for chart libraries"
Task: "Add compression for static assets"
```

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Tasks are designed to be incremental and reversible
- Each task includes validation steps
- Fallback approaches documented for complex fixes
- Regular checkpoint commits to prevent loss of progress

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
