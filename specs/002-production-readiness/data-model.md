# Production Readiness Data Model

**Feature**: 002-production-readiness
**Phase**: Design (Phase 1)
**Date**: 2025-01-27

## Overview

This data model defines the entities, relationships, and data structures required for resolving production readiness issues. Focus is on configuration, error tracking, and validation entities rather than new business logic.

## Core Entities

### 1. TypeScript Error Entity

**Purpose**: Track and categorize TypeScript compilation errors for systematic resolution

```typescript
interface TypeScriptError {
  id: string;                    // Unique error identifier
  file_path: string;             // Absolute path to file with error
  line_number: number;           // Line number of error
  column_number: number;         // Column number of error
  error_code: string;            // TypeScript error code (e.g., ts2375, ts6133)
  error_message: string;         // Full error message
  category: ErrorCategory;       // Classification of error type
  severity: ErrorSeverity;       // Priority level for resolution
  status: ErrorStatus;           // Current resolution status
  resolution_notes?: string;     // How the error was resolved
  created_at: Date;             // When error was first detected
  resolved_at?: Date;           // When error was resolved
}

enum ErrorCategory {
  TYPE_MISMATCH = "type_mismatch",
  IMPLICIT_ANY = "implicit_any",
  MISSING_TYPES = "missing_types",
  PROPERTY_VIOLATION = "property_violation",
  IMPORT_EXPORT = "import_export",
  STRICT_MODE = "strict_mode"
}

enum ErrorSeverity {
  CRITICAL = "critical",    // Blocks build
  HIGH = "high",           // Core functionality impact
  MEDIUM = "medium",       // Non-critical features
  LOW = "low"              // Developer experience
}

enum ErrorStatus {
  IDENTIFIED = "identified",
  IN_PROGRESS = "in_progress",
  RESOLVED = "resolved",
  DEFERRED = "deferred"
}
```

**Validation Rules**:
- `file_path` must be valid and within project directory
- `line_number` and `column_number` must be positive integers
- `error_code` must match TypeScript error code pattern
- `resolved_at` can only be set when status is "resolved"

### 2. API Health Entity

**Purpose**: Monitor and track API endpoint health and connectivity status

```typescript
interface APIHealthCheck {
  id: string;                    // Unique health check identifier
  endpoint_path: string;         // API endpoint path (e.g., /api/user/profile)
  http_method: HTTPMethod;       // HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
  expected_status: number;       // Expected HTTP status code
  actual_status?: number;        // Actual HTTP status code received
  response_time?: number;        // Response time in milliseconds
  error_message?: string;        // Error details if failed
  status: HealthStatus;          // Current health status
  last_checked: Date;            // When last health check was performed
  consecutive_failures: number;  // Number of consecutive failures
  environment: Environment;      // Which environment was tested
}

enum HTTPMethod {
  GET = "GET",
  POST = "POST",
  PUT = "PUT",
  PATCH = "PATCH",
  DELETE = "DELETE"
}

enum HealthStatus {
  HEALTHY = "healthy",
  DEGRADED = "degraded",
  FAILED = "failed",
  UNKNOWN = "unknown"
}

enum Environment {
  DEVELOPMENT = "development",
  STAGING = "staging",
  PRODUCTION = "production"
}
```

**Validation Rules**:
- `endpoint_path` must start with "/" and be valid URL path
- `expected_status` must be valid HTTP status code (100-599)
- `response_time` must be non-negative if provided
- `consecutive_failures` must be non-negative integer

### 3. Database Connection Entity

**Purpose**: Track database connectivity and query performance

```typescript
interface DatabaseHealth {
  id: string;                    // Unique database health identifier
  connection_name: string;       // Connection identifier (e.g., "supabase_main")
  host: string;                 // Database host
  database_name: string;        // Database name
  connection_status: ConnectionStatus;
  query_test_status: QueryStatus;
  average_query_time?: number;   // Average query time in milliseconds
  connection_pool_size?: number; // Current connection pool size
  error_message?: string;        // Connection error details
  last_tested: Date;            // When last tested
  environment: Environment;      // Environment being tested
}

enum ConnectionStatus {
  CONNECTED = "connected",
  DISCONNECTED = "disconnected",
  TIMEOUT = "timeout",
  ERROR = "error"
}

enum QueryStatus {
  SUCCESS = "success",
  SLOW = "slow",           // Query successful but slow
  FAILED = "failed",
  NOT_TESTED = "not_tested"
}
```

**Validation Rules**:
- `host` must be valid hostname or IP address
- `database_name` must be non-empty string
- `average_query_time` must be positive if provided
- `connection_pool_size` must be positive integer if provided

### 4. Build Configuration Entity

**Purpose**: Track build process configuration and performance

```typescript
interface BuildConfiguration {
  id: string;                    // Unique build configuration identifier
  environment: Environment;      // Target environment
  node_version: string;         // Node.js version used
  typescript_version: string;   // TypeScript version
  astro_version: string;        // Astro framework version
  build_command: string;        // Command used for build
  build_status: BuildStatus;    // Current build status
  build_time?: number;          // Build time in seconds
  bundle_size?: number;         // Total bundle size in bytes
  error_count: number;          // Number of build errors
  warning_count: number;        // Number of build warnings
  created_at: Date;            // When build was attempted
  completed_at?: Date;         // When build completed (success or failure)
  error_log?: string;          // Build error details
}

enum BuildStatus {
  PENDING = "pending",
  BUILDING = "building",
  SUCCESS = "success",
  FAILED = "failed",
  CANCELLED = "cancelled"
}
```

**Validation Rules**:
- Version strings must follow semantic versioning pattern
- `build_time` must be positive if provided
- `bundle_size` must be non-negative if provided
- `error_count` and `warning_count` must be non-negative
- `completed_at` can only be set when status is not "pending" or "building"

### 5. Production Deployment Entity

**Purpose**: Track deployment status and environment configuration

```typescript
interface ProductionDeployment {
  id: string;                    // Unique deployment identifier
  version: string;              // Application version being deployed
  commit_hash: string;          // Git commit hash
  deployment_status: DeploymentStatus;
  deployment_platform: string;  // Platform (e.g., "zeabur", "vercel")
  domain: string;               // Deployment domain
  deployment_url?: string;      // Full deployment URL
  health_check_url?: string;    // Health check endpoint URL
  environment_variables: EnvironmentVariable[];
  deployment_time?: number;     // Deployment time in seconds
  rollback_available: boolean;  // Whether rollback is possible
  created_at: Date;            // When deployment started
  deployed_at?: Date;          // When deployment completed
  error_message?: string;      // Deployment error details
}

interface EnvironmentVariable {
  key: string;                  // Environment variable name
  is_set: boolean;             // Whether variable is configured
  is_sensitive: boolean;       // Whether variable contains secrets
  validation_status: ValidationStatus;
}

enum DeploymentStatus {
  QUEUED = "queued",
  DEPLOYING = "deploying",
  SUCCESS = "success",
  FAILED = "failed",
  ROLLED_BACK = "rolled_back"
}

enum ValidationStatus {
  VALID = "valid",
  INVALID = "invalid",
  NOT_VALIDATED = "not_validated"
}
```

**Validation Rules**:
- `version` must follow semantic versioning
- `commit_hash` must be valid git commit hash
- `domain` must be valid domain name
- Environment variable `key` must be valid identifier
- `deployment_time` must be positive if provided

## Entity Relationships

```
TypeScriptError -> Build Configuration (many-to-one)
  - Errors are detected during build process

APIHealthCheck -> Deployment (many-to-one)
  - Health checks validate deployed endpoints

DatabaseHealth -> Environment (many-to-one)
  - Each environment has its own database health

BuildConfiguration -> Deployment (one-to-one)
  - Successful builds can be deployed

ProductionDeployment -> APIHealthCheck (one-to-many)
  - Deployments trigger health checks
```

## State Transitions

### TypeScript Error Resolution Flow
```
IDENTIFIED → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED
    ↓
DEFERRED (can return to IN_PROGRESS)
```

### Build Process Flow
```
PENDING → BUILDING → SUCCESS → Deployment
    ↓         ↓
CANCELLED   FAILED
```

### Deployment Flow
```
QUEUED → DEPLOYING → SUCCESS
    ↓        ↓          ↓
CANCELLED  FAILED   ROLLED_BACK
```

## Data Storage Strategy

**Local Development**:
- Store entities in JSON files for quick iteration
- Use file-based persistence for error tracking
- No database required for development

**Production**:
- Use existing Supabase instance with `production_` table prefix
- Leverage existing authentication and security
- Implement proper data retention policies

**Tables Required**:
```sql
-- TypeScript error tracking
production_typescript_errors

-- API health monitoring
production_api_health

-- Database connectivity monitoring
production_database_health

-- Build configuration tracking
production_build_configs

-- Deployment tracking
production_deployments
production_environment_variables
```

## Integration Points

**TypeScript Compiler API**:
- Extract errors programmatically from `tsc --listFiles --noEmit`
- Parse error output to populate TypeScriptError entities
- Track resolution progress

**API Testing Framework**:
- Automated health checks using contract tests
- Populate APIHealthCheck entities from test results
- Continuous monitoring setup

**Build System Integration**:
- Hook into Astro build process for metrics collection
- Track build performance and bundle analysis
- Store BuildConfiguration entities for trend analysis

**Deployment Platform Integration**:
- Integration with Zeabur deployment API
- Webhook handling for deployment status updates
- Environment variable validation

## Performance Considerations

**Data Volume**:
- TypeScript errors: ~1000 records (one per error)
- API health checks: ~100 records (ongoing monitoring)
- Build configurations: ~50 records (per environment/version)
- Deployments: ~20 records (production deployments)

**Query Patterns**:
- Active errors by severity (for prioritization)
- Recent health check status (for monitoring dashboards)
- Build performance trends (for optimization)
- Deployment success rates (for reliability metrics)

**Indexing Strategy**:
```sql
-- For error resolution prioritization
CREATE INDEX idx_ts_errors_status_severity ON production_typescript_errors(status, severity);

-- For health monitoring
CREATE INDEX idx_api_health_endpoint_status ON production_api_health(endpoint_path, status);

-- For deployment tracking
CREATE INDEX idx_deployments_status_created ON production_deployments(deployment_status, created_at);
```
