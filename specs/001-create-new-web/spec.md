# Feature Specification: AI Trading System Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-new-web`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create new web application named ai-trading-system based on '/home/omarb/dev/projects/ai-trading-system/context/ai-trading-system-full-context.md' and specifications '/home/omarb/dev/projects/ai-trading-system/context/ai-trading-system-specification-requirements.md'"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description provided with context files
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: AI trading simulator, cryptocurrency predictions, backtesting, portfolio showcase
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All requirements clearly specified in context documents
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flows defined for simulation and backtesting
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ All requirements derived from specification documents
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Trading entities identified from database schema
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec complete and ready for implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A visitor to bizkit.dev discovers the AI Trading System project and wants to test cryptocurrency trading strategies without risking real money. They can run simulations using AI-powered predictions, analyze performance through backtesting, and save their trading history for future reference.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits ai-trading.bizkit.dev, **When** they start a new simulation without logging in, **Then** they can execute simulated trades with notional capital and see real-time results
2. **Given** a logged-in user selects a cryptocurrency and time period, **When** they run a backtest, **Then** they see historical performance metrics including win rate, returns, and trade visualization
3. **Given** a user has completed trades, **When** they view their portfolio dashboard, **Then** they see their current positions, profit/loss, and equity growth charts
4. **Given** a user on bizkit.dev, **When** they click the AI Trading System project link, **Then** they navigate seamlessly to ai-trading.bizkit.dev while maintaining their login state

### Edge Cases
- What happens when market data APIs are unavailable or rate-limited?
- How does the system handle AI model prediction failures or unrealistic outputs?
- What occurs when a user's simulated portfolio value drops to zero?
- How are concurrent trading sessions managed for the same user?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to execute simulated buy/sell trades using AI-generated price predictions
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement risk management protocols including stop-loss orders and take-profit rules
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide backtesting functionality using historical cryptocurrency price data
- **FR-004**: System MUST display interactive charts showing price movements, trade markers, and equity growth
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain a detailed trade log with timestamps, actions, prices, quantities, and profit/loss calculations
- **FR-006**: System MUST calculate and display performance metrics including final capital, win rate, return percentage, and maximum drawdown
- **FR-007**: System MUST integrate machine learning models for short-term cryptocurrency price prediction
- **FR-008**: System MUST retrieve live and historical market data from cryptocurrency APIs
- **FR-009**: System MUST support both guest usage and authenticated user sessions
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve user trade history and preferences for logged-in users
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide seamless single sign-on across bizkit.dev subdomains
- **FR-012**: System MUST display a consistent neon cyberpunk user interface that is responsive across devices
- **FR-013**: System MUST include navigation back to the main bizkit.dev portfolio
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle API rate limits gracefully and cache market data appropriately
- **FR-015**: System MUST start each simulation with a configurable amount of notional capital

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Trading User**: Represents a user's trading-specific profile data linked to authentication, including preferences and settings
- **Trade**: Individual simulated buy/sell transaction records with cryptocurrency symbol, action type, price, quantity, timestamp, and profit/loss
- **Trading Run**: Complete backtesting or simulation session containing summary metrics, performance data, and associated trades
- **Market Data**: Real-time and historical cryptocurrency price information, sentiment indicators, and market metadata
- **AI Prediction**: Machine learning model outputs providing price forecasts and trading signals for decision-making
